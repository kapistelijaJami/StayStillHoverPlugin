# Stay Still Hover Plugin for BakkesMod

This plugin is a rocket league plugin for bakkesmod. It allows you to spin in place any direction without moving anywhere.
If target orientation is enabled, you will try to match the orientation of the target, and keep it there for a bit before time runs out.
The target will match your roll if enabled. You can roll constantly, not roll at all, or roll when you feel comfortable. (The first two will be more challenging).

## Installation

Build with Visual Studio. It should automatically copy the .dll file to C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\bakkesmod\bakkesmod/plugins\ folder and then be ready to use.
